## Business use case and type of blockchain to use

Encouraging the community to stay healthy and active by rewarding when they buy healthier products (foods, exercise equipment.. etc) 
and engaginghealthier activities (exercises, health checkups, participating health awareness programs)

Developing blockchain based Health Coins as a reward. These health coins will be implemented  etherium based ERC20  token.
Coins will be earned by engaging different activities for example

Food/product logging, logging Exercises, participating health awareness programs, logging health checkups.

We can tie up with food/product vendors where the user can just upload a picture of the invoice,
or scan QR codes printed on scratch stickers and system can parse the items they have ordered.

Individual users are able to redeem by authorizing partners to read & deduct Health Coins.

We can design an intelligent platform to rewarding HealthCoins based on user activities such as how frequent they do exercises,
how often they log food, how much they are having sleep and rewards HealthCoins when user achieve the goal. We can collect these 
informations by using APIs of fitness trackers like FitBit.

Encourage users to do frequent health checkups by rewarding coins per health checkup.
Partnering with hospitals and medical Centres to collect these information.

Allow an end-user to pay with HealthCoins thru their smart devices.
for example,When individual users buy health/fitness equipment from partnered retail shops,
they can  collect HealthCoins and also redeem their previous health coins.


## Why Blockchain?

There will be multiple parties involving. Because of that instead of having single organization handling individuals data and information blockchain based decentralize network will provide a trust among all the entities. Community will get rewarded to their information and data in a digital currency.
Proof of Engagement is a way users can earn health coin tokens on the platform. 

## Scope

Implementing an ERC20 based health coin which can be earn by engaging healthier life style activities and use it to purchase goods and services. The platform is designed in such a way that it incentivizes the participating community by logging these engaging activities and get the reward in form of tokens.
